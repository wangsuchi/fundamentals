1. the main purpose of docker is to package and containerize apps and to ship them and run them anywhere anytime you want
2. difference between docker vs virtual machine?
  (1)docker shares hardware instructure and os. The containers that run on docker only contains software and its libraries and dependencies
  (2)vm runs on hypervisor, which runs on hardware infrastructure. every vm has its own os and other necessary libraries and dependencies.⇒more isolation
  (3)The vm overhead causes higher utilization of resources,including disk consumption, which is usually gigabytes in size. Wherereas docker container is 
     lightly, which is usually megabytes in size⇒results in faster boot-up
  This is not an either A or B situation. You will often see containers provisioned on virtual machine  
3.Containers are meant to run a specific task or process such as to host an instance of a web server or db or application server.
Once the task is complete, the container exits. So a container only lives as long as the process inside it.
4. Container dependent on particular image.
5.docker command
  (1)docker run [image_name]                           if the image is not present on the host it will go out to docker hub and pull it down
  (2)docker run -d [image_name]                        run in the background
  (3)docker run [image_name:{version_number}]          docker run redis:4.0←tag appended (if not specified, will be the latest version)
  (4)docker run -it                                    The -it instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the container’s stdin; creating an interactive bash shell in the container. 
  (5)docker run --name [container_name] [image_name]   you can customize the container name by option --name
  (6)docker pull [image_name]                          pull image only without running it
  (7)docker ps                                         list all running containers and some basic information(containerID,image,status,names←containerNameRandomlyMadeUpByPC)
  (8)docker ps -a                                      list all running as well as previously stopped or exited containers
  (9)docker stop [containerID/name]
  (10)docker rm [containerID/name]                      delete container for good
  (11)docker images                                     list all images
  (12)docker rmi [image_name]                          Must ensure that no containers are running off of that image before attempting to remove image.Must stop and
                                                       delete all dependent containers before deleting that image.
  (13)docker rm $(docker ps -aq)                       remove all containers at once  
  (14)docker exec [containerID/name] [linux_command]   execute command inside container, docker exec cla19d3a7ca7 cat /etc/hosts
  (15)docker inspect [containerID]                     get the internal ip address of container
  
6.Run - PORT mapping
docker run -p 80:8080 kodekloud/webapp (map docker host port 80 with container port 8080)
One docker host port can map to only one single container port. 
container has its own default internal ip address, you can access with this ip address inside the docker server.

7.Run- Volume mapping
docker run -v /opt/datadir:/var/lib/mysql mysql(docker_host_path:container_path )
when docker container runs, it will implicitly mount the external directory to a folder inside the docker container.In this way, your data is still there even if the container is deleted.
