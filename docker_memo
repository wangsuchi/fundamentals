1. the main purpose of docker is to package and containerize apps and to ship them and run them anywhere anytime you want
2. difference between docker vs virtual machine?
  (1)docker shares hardware instructure and os. The containers that run on docker only contains software and its libraries and dependencies
  (2)vm runs on hypervisor, which runs on hardware infrastructure. every vm has its own os and other necessary libraries and dependencies.⇒more isolation
  (3)The vm overhead causes higher utilization of resources,including disk consumption, which is usually gigabytes in size. Wherereas docker container is 
     lightly, which is usually megabytes in size⇒results in faster boot-up
  This is not an either A or B situation. You will often see containers provisioned on virtual machine
