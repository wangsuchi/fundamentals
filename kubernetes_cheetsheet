1. ETCD
(1)what is ETCD?
  a distributed reliable key-value store, that is simple, secure & fast
  
(2)ETCDCTL is the CLI tool used to interact with ETCD.ETCDCTL can interact with ETCD Server using 2 API versions - Version 2 and Version 3.  
By default its set to use Version 2. Each version has different sets of commands.

For example ETCDCTL version 2 supports the following commands:
etcdctl backup
etcdctl cluster-health
etcdctl mk
etcdctl mkdir
etcdctl set

Whereas the commands are different in version 3
etcdctl snapshot save 
etcdctl endpoint health
etcdctl get
etcdctl put

To set the right version of API set the environment variable ETCDCTL_API command
export ETCDCTL_API=3

When API version is not set, it is assumed to be set to version 2. And version 3 commands listed above don't work. 
When API version is set to version 3, version 2 commands listed above don't work.

Apart from that, you must also specify path to certificate files so that ETCDCTL can authenticate to the ETCD API Server. 
The certificate files are available in the etcd-master at the following path. 
--cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt     
--cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt     
--key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
