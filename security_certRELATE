SSL TLS certificates
(1)symmetric key
(2)asymmetric key, private public

PKI(public key infrastructure)
when user first accesses the server with https, the user get the server's public key my.pem,
(created by command openssl genrsa -out my.key 1024, openssl rsa -in my.key -pubout > my.pem)
the user then encrypt the symmetric key using my.pem, and then send it to the server, the server uses my.key to decrypt the message to get the symmetric key.

How to prove the public key my.pem you received is legitimate?
Here comes the certificate.
we use the public key of CA to decrypt the certificate, to retrieve the server's public key.
CA uses their private keys to sign the certificates. the public keys are already built in your browser


certificate(public key)
*.crt *.pem

private key
*.key *-key.pem
