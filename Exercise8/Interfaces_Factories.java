//Many people have fallen to this temptation, creating interfaces and factories wherever it’s
//possible. The logic seems to be that you might need to use a different implementation, so you
//should always add that abstraction. It has become a kind of premature design optimization.
//Any abstraction should be motivated by a real need. Interfaces should be something you
//refactor to when necessary, rather than installing the extra level of indirection everywhere,
//along with the extra complexity. That extra complexity is significant, and if you make
//someone work through that complexity only to realize that you’ve added interfaces "just in
//case" and for no compelling reason—well, if I see such a thing I begin to question all the
//designs that this particular person has done.
